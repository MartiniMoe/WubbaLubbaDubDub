Hence, I created it myself.Example usage in an animationhttps://youtu.be/iLolb50OSRo- Fan art, heed the warning- CC0, I'd love credit but you don't have to give it- Included is a pre-animated strumming of the strings.- Includes a snippet of a CC0 soundbyte of someone playing the Ukelele. - Low poly with higher poly modifiers.- Setup for freestyle, shadeless look.- The only texture used is actually created by rendering the polygons on layer 2, so you can get a higher resolution if needed (switch to that camera). Layer 1: Ukelele, group with armatureLayer 2: model used to render out textureSee more!http://www.blendswap.com/user/TheDuckCowwww.theduckcow.comMoo-Ack!Patrick W.
